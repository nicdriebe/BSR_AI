#### 4 days + 1 given dataset + 3 Machine Learning Models

In this study project at HTW, predictions for the upcoming year were made 
based on a dataset from BSR regarding waste generation over the past four years. 
To enhance the predictions, additional publicly available datasets (e.g., weather data, school holidays, public holidays, and election surveys) 
were incorporated. The results are summarized in the [documentation](Dokumentation.pdf).
